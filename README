# stanford-parser-util-java

Java utility classes to simplify use of the Stanford Parser for a specific configuration for parsing English sentences.

My goal is to provide access to a parser that can handle simple English sentences, so that the surface structure can be used to generate a logical form that can be interpreted in a model-theory semantics. See http://github.com/jimtyhurst/generalized-quantifiers for the beginnings of such a semantic analyzer written in Clojure.

## Usage

See the unit tests in LexicalizedParserTest for examples. For example,
Tree tree = getParserModule().buildParser().getBestParse("every male student read some book");
